# 🛍️ Retail Data Analysis Project

##  Executive Summary
This project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover key business insights, segment customers, and build predictive models.  
The work involves **data cleaning and preprocessing in Python**, **interactive dashboarding in Power BI**, and **machine learning** for customer segmentation and product recommendations.

---

## 💡 Business Problem
Retailers need a clear understanding of **sales trends**, **customer behavior**, and **product preferences** to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.  
This project provides actionable insights and machine learning solutions that support **data-driven decision making** and **personalized customer experiences**.

---

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, invalid transactions, and inconsistent data types.  
- Created new features like `TotalPrice` and extracted date/time components for deeper analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Dashboard
- Performed detailed **sales and customer analysis** using Python visualizations and Power BI.  
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to display:
  - Sales by month, day, and hour  
  - Regional and product category performance  
  - Customer purchasing behavior and preferences  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Engineered meaningful features to improve model performance.  
- Enhanced interpretability by deriving time-based and customer-specific metrics.

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applied clustering to identify distinct customer groups.  
- **Product Recommendation System:** Trained a recommendation algorithm to suggest products based on purchase history.  
- Evaluated and tuned models to ensure effective segmentation and recommendations.
