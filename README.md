<h1 align="center">Retail Data Analysis Project</h1>


**1.Executive Summary**

This project focuses on analyzing retail transaction data to extract business insights, perform customer segmentation, and build predictive models. The process involves data cleaning using Python libraries, creating an interactive sales dashboard with Power BI, and training machine learning models for product recommendations.
#
**2.Business Problem**

Retailers require insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product preferences to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management. The project aims to provide these insights and enable personalized product recommendations to boost customer engagement.
#
**3.Methodology**
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

- Cleaned the dataset using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy).

- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, fixed data types, and eliminated invalid transactions.

**Exploratory Data Analysis & Dashboard**:

- Created a Power BI dashboard visualizing sales trends by month, day, and hour.

- Analyzed regional performance and product category sales.

- Evaluated customer behavior by purchase frequency, shipping preferences, and subscription status.

**Feature Engineering**:

- Engineered features like TotalPrice and extracted date components for detailed analysis.

**Machine Learning Models**:

- Trained two machine learning models (e.g., clustering for customer segmentation, and a recommendation algorithm).

- Evaluated models for effectiveness in segmenting customers and recommending products.
#
**4.Skills Demonstrated**
